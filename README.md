## <a name="About">About</a>
A former airline manager with a background in marketing looking for an opportunity to start a career in web development. Having completed a highly intensive course at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/about-us/) I am excited to take my skills to the next level.

####Self-starter

  I moved to the UK back in 2009 to start my second degree. It was a daunting task, I had nothing, just a bag and a placement at Queen Mary University I didn’t know anyone in London. I barely spoke the language and had no idea what was to come next. I had to learn fast luckily is an ability I have.
  After leaving Queens Mary’s with a masters in Management and Organisational Innovations I landed a role in Civil Aviation and despite being very new to the industry, I quickly made a name for myself.

####Quick learner

  I’ve achieved all this through constant learning. It is truly amazing how much you can actually accomplish in just a few weeks. For the Makers Academy final project still being a beginner with JavaScript, I completed a project using two brand-new technologies Ionic framework and decoupled backend. While being familiar with Rails, Ionic was not taught on the course and I managed to learn and build a fully functioning mobile app using this framework within two weeks.

####With the system of things

  Being proud of my analytical mind-set I really thrive when it comes to complexity. I find it relatively easy to see the big picture. So for example, with one of the projects at Makers I got the chance to participate in building a gem that tracks and removes unused files within rails project. I managed to come up with quite a simple solution to the problem we were trying to solve.
  Another example is my work on e-Boarder integration project while at Transaero Airlines as UK Country Manager. As you may not be aware (I hope you’re not) a few years ago the UK Government has decided to follow the US approach in advancing obtaining passenger information (APIS). I worked in collaboration with an IT Department to provide the software allowing the integration of UK Border Agency (e-Borders) with the reservation, check-in system and into the dispatch part of it as well. This required from me deep and thorough analysis of potential pitfall along all the way of the Airline's operation.
